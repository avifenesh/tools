# @agent-sh/harness-read

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c3b9f5: Harness tool hardening — fixes for failure modes surfaced by real-model use.

  - **tools**: wire a shared per-process `InMemoryLedger` into the read and
    write/edit sessions. Previously neither session carried a ledger, so Read
    recorded nothing and every Edit/Write hit `NOT_READ_THIS_SESSION` and
    hard-denied — pushing models to fall back to `cat`/`sed` via Bash. The
    read-before-edit gate now works as designed.
  - **write**: preserve the file's original line endings (and BOM) on edit. Edits
    matched on CRLF→LF-normalized content but wrote the normalized (LF) bytes back,
    silently converting CRLF files to LF. Matching stays normalized; output keeps
    the file's convention.
  - **write**: the read-gate now fails open per Read spec D11 — a missing ledger
    entry asks the permission hook (deny only on explicit deny) or proceeds with a
    warning when no hook is wired, instead of a hard deny. `STALE_READ` stays hard.
  - **read**: read the file once for both content and sha256 (was reading twice);
    remove env-gated debug `console.error` from shipped source.
  - **grep**: add `fixed_strings` for literal search (ripgrep `-F`), skipping the
    regex compile-probe; `INVALID_REGEX` now points to it as the escape-free path.
  - **bash**: tool description steers stalling network calls (curl/wget) to
    `background: true` or an explicit client timeout, alongside servers/watchers.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6dbe9b0: Initial public release.

  Nine standalone tools plus an umbrella, each with a full cross-language design spec, per-tool permission model, fail-closed hooks, and discriminated-union result shapes. Matching Rust ports ship under `crates/` and are validated against real LLM traces via the `packages/harness-e2e` harness.

  Included in this release:

  - `@agent-sh/harness-core` — shared types, errors, permissions, operation adapters
  - `@agent-sh/harness-read` — safe bounded file reading
  - `@agent-sh/harness-write` — atomic write + edit + multiedit with read-before-edit ledger
  - `@agent-sh/harness-grep` — ripgrep-backed search with discriminated output_mode
  - `@agent-sh/harness-glob` — file discovery by pattern
  - `@agent-sh/harness-bash` — shell with cwd-carry, timeouts, background jobs
  - `@agent-sh/harness-webfetch` — HTTP with SSRF defense and readability+markdown extraction
  - `@agent-sh/harness-lsp` — language-server operations with 1-indexed positions
  - `@agent-sh/harness-skill` — [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) activation
  - `@agent-sh/harness-tools` — umbrella re-export of every tool
