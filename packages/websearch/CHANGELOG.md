# @agent-sh/harness-websearch

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 8158441: Self-contained zero-config web search + token-efficient output + RRF ranking.

  `websearch` now works with **no API key and no self-hosted service**: with nothing
  configured it queries a bundled keyless fallback chain (Mojeek → Marginalia →
  Wikipedia) and returns the first backend with results. Optional Brave/Tavily API
  keys or a self-hosted SearXNG remain supported and take priority when configured.

  - **BREAKING**: the `INVALID_PARAM: no search backend configured` error is gone —
    zero config now uses the keyless chain instead of failing. Output rendering
    changed to a compact ranked-text format (the `<search>` XML block was replaced);
    parse the structured `meta`/`results`, not the `output` string.
  - Token-efficient compact output (~18% smaller at count=5), an engine-class label
    (`general web` / `indie/small-web index` / `encyclopedic`), and honest recency
    (per-result `age` only when the backend provides it; an explicit "time filter
    NOT applied" note when the serving engine ignores `time_range`).
  - Cross-engine gather + merge with a sufficiency threshold, URL de-duplication,
    engine-class-aware empty/degraded handling, rate-limit (401/403/429) →
    `SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE`, per-engine timeout fairness, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion
    with engine weights for merge ranking.
  - New session options: `braveApiKey`, `tavilyApiKey`, `disableMojeek`,
    `fallbackToKeyless`, `snippetCap`, `engineBaseUrls`.

  Validated end-to-end against a real model (full websearch e2e suite, 10/10 on both
  the TS and Rust engines). The Rust crate (`harness-websearch`) is updated at parity.

## 0.3.0
