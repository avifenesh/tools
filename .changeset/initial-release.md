Initial public release.

Nine standalone tools plus an umbrella, each with a full cross-language design spec, per-tool permission model, fail-closed hooks, and discriminated-union result shapes. Matching Rust ports ship under `crates/` and are validated against real LLM traces via the `packages/harness-e2e` harness.

Included in this release:

- `@agent-sh/harness-core` — shared types, errors, permissions, operation adapters
- `@agent-sh/harness-read` — safe bounded file reading
- `@agent-sh/harness-write` — atomic write + edit + multiedit with read-before-edit ledger
- `@agent-sh/harness-grep` — ripgrep-backed search with discriminated output_mode
- `@agent-sh/harness-glob` — file discovery by pattern
- `@agent-sh/harness-bash` — shell with cwd-carry, timeouts, background jobs
- `@agent-sh/harness-webfetch` — HTTP with SSRF defense and readability+markdown extraction
- `@agent-sh/harness-lsp` — language-server operations with 1-indexed positions
- `@agent-sh/harness-skill` — [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) activation
- `@agent-sh/harness-tools` — umbrella re-export of every tool
